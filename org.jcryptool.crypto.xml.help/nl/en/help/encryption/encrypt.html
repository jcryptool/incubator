	<p>
		The <b>XML Encryption Wizard</b> consists of three pages, with a
		variable second page depending on the chosen keystore/ key option. To
		launch the wizard you either have to select an XML document in one of
		the supported views in the XML perspective or open an XML document in
		the WTP XML editor (in any perspective). Open the context menu, choose
		<b>XML Security</b> and click on <b>New Encryption...</b>. In order to
		encrypt a selected XML fragment select the desired document part in
		the editor and launch the wizard as described before. The selection
		has to exist before launching the wizard, and it has to be
		well-formed: in case a start-tag is selected the end-tag must be
		selected too. Encrypting only text-content of an element is possible
		too.
