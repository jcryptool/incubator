	<p>
		The <b>XML Security</b> preferences are available as sub-pages in the
		<b>XML</b> category. Three pages are available, from general settings
		on the <b>XML Security</b> page to specific settings for <a
			href="encryption.html">Encryption</a>
		and <a
			href="signature.html">Signatures</a>.
	</p>
	<p>The general XML Security Tools preference page allows you to
		specify some general settings for the whole plug-in.</p>

	<p>By default, an exclusive XML canonicalization is executed when
		selecting on of the Canonicalization entries in the menu. Select the
		inclusive option in case you do require this canonicalization type.
		The canonicalization target is normally the same file, so the original
		file gets manipulated. In case you do want to keep the original file
		you can select to create a new document for canonicalization. This
		only affects canonicalization, not any of the other wizards! Creating
		a new file adds _canon to the filename, with additional numbering in
		case this file already exists.</p>
