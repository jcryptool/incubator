	<p>
		XML Canonicalization does not open any wizard or view. Instead, it
		directly canonicalizes (normalizes) the selected XML document (always
		the complete document). Depending on the selected menu entry it either
		maintains the comments or removes them. Removed comments are replaced
		by an empty line. The <b>XML Security</b> <a
			href="../preferences/general.html">preferences</a> allow you to
		switch between <i>inclusive</i> and <i>exclusive</i> XML
		canonicalization, which may result into different canonicalized
		versions of the XML document (the differences depend on the XML
		document).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>XML Canonicalization</b> always takes place when signing an XML
		document or verifying an XML Signature. There is no need to execute
		this task manually (but it does not do any damage in case you do).
