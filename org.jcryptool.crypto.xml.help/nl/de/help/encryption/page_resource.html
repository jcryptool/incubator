	<p>This is the first page of the XML Encryption Wizard. You'll have
		to select the resource you want to encrypt, the encryption type, the
		keystore/ key option and the Basic Security Profile option.</p>

		<b>Resource</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		It is possible to encrypt the complete document, the selected text or
		a document fragment specified by an XPath expression. The complete
		document is always possible. For a text selection this selection has
		to exist before launching the wizard and it has to be well-formed.
		XPath is always possible too. You can either enter an XPath expression
		in the textfield or you can select one in the dialog after clicking on
		the <b>Browse...</b> button. The XPath expression has to return
		exactly one element or element content. Encrypting attributes is not
		supported.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Encryption Type</b>
	</p>
	<p>The normal encryption type is a so called enveloping encryption,
		where the encrypted data is contained in the original document (it
		replaces the plain XML). A detached encryption doesn't encrypt the XML
		document you have chosen. Instead the data in the specified additional
		file here gets encrypted. Both documents will be changed. File A
		remains in plain XML, but does contain the encryption information for
		file B that gets encrypted (a detached encryption requires the whole
		document to be encrypted).</p>
	<p>
		<b>Keystore and Key</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		The chosen option here sets the following wizard page. You can either
		select to <a
			href="page_open_key.html">Use
			a key from an existing keystore</a>, to <a
			href="page_create_key.html">Insert
			a new key in an existing keystore</a> or to <a
			href="page_create_keystore.html">Create
			a new key and a new keystore</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Basic Security Profile</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		A Basic Security Profile compliant XML Encryption has some
		restrictions in comparison to a regular XML Encryption. By activating
		this checkbox all options in the XML Encryption Wizard will be limited
		to options that are compliant to this profile. In case of the XML
		Encryption Wizard this only limits the available algorithms on the <a
			href="page_algorithms.html">Algorithms
			and Encryption Properties</a> page.
