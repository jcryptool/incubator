JCrypTool Incubator
=======

The **JCrypTool Incubator** repository contains all crypto plug-ins for JCrypTool that are not yet ready to ship in our stable release.

These projects require the plug-ins from the [JCrypTool Core](https://github.com/jcryptool/core) repository to compile and to run and may require additional plug-ins from the [JCrypTool Crypto](https://github.com/jcryptool/crypto) repository.

Have a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/jcryptool/core/wiki) for more information, especially the [Getting started as a JCrypTool Developer](https://github.com/jcryptool/core/wiki/Getting-started-as-a-JCrypTool-Developer) page. Feel free to ask any question you might have in our [developers group](http://groups.google.com/group/jcryptool-developers).

JCrypTool downloads are available as [weekly builds](http://www.cryptool.org/en/jct-downloads-en/jct-downloads-weekly-en) (unstable) and as [release builds](http://www.cryptool.org/en/jct-downloads-en/jct-downloads-stable-en) (stable).

General information on the CrypTool and JCrypTool projects is available in the [CrypTool](http://www.cryptool.org) portal.
